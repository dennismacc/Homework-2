# Homework-2

The purpose of this project was to use learned skills to use HTML source code to create a portfolio from scratch and then use CSS to style the webpage.

This project allowed me to practice writing source code and using semantic elements to create and webpage that had good flow and content. I was also able to use CSS styling skills to make the webpage more interactive and appealing to users. I learned the importance of creating a foundational source code first, and then builiding upon that source code and adding additional elements. I tried to keep my webpage design simple while still utilizing styling techniques that demonstrate a compentency with HTML and CSS.
